Hello! I am an Assistant Professor and the Silverman (1968) Family Career Development Professor at MIT <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" target="_blank">EECS</a> and <a href="https://lids.mit.edu/" target="_blank">LIDS</a>. I am also a co-founder and Chair of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a>, a global nonprofit initiative to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. 

My research focuses on machine learning for forecasting, optimization, and control in high-renewables power grids. Methodologically, this entails exploring ways to incorporate relevant physics, hard constraints, and decision-making procedures into deep learning workflows.


I am a recipient of the MIT Technology Review's 2021 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/innovators-under-35/2021/" target="_blank">"35 Innovators Under 35"</a> award and the 2022 ACM SIGEnergy Doctoral Dissertation Award.

**I am currently accepting PhD students.** Students who are interested in working with me should apply through MIT EECS and list me in their application; more instructions are <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/" target="_blank">here</a>. I am unfortunately unlikely to be able to respond to individual email inquiries or meet with prospective PhD students outside of the formal application process.

Previously, I was a <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/phd/startup-postdocs/">Runway Startup Postdoc</a> at Cornell Tech and the Jacobs Institute. 
I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Department of Engineering & Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), 
co-advised by <a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a> and <a href="https://ines.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
At CMU, I held the U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship, the Siebel Scholarship, and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Before starting my Ph.D., I was a <a href="https://watson.foundation/" target="_blank">Thomas J. Watson Fellow</a>, traveling the world to study the people, technologies, and policies behind next-generation electricity systems.
I received my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>, with a major in computer science and math as well as an emphasis in environmental analysis.
