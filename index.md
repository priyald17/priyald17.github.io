Hello! I am Ph.D. student in 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>
and 
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by 
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>
and
<a href="http://www.inesazevedo.org/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and electric power systems, using algorithmic and policy analytic approaches to promote efficient and low-emission operation of the energy grid.
I am funded through the U.S. Department of Energy's 
<a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" target="_blank">Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a>
and was previously an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

Before CMU, I was a 
<a href="https://watson.foundation/" target="_blank">Thomas J. Watson Fellow</a>
traveling the world to study the people, technologies, and policies behind next-generation electricity systems (project blog 
<a href="https://priyaswatson.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a>). 
I did my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College in Computer Science/Math with an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis.
